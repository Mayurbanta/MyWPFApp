	Example:
		<Label content="{Binding obj}">
			<Label.ContentTemplate>
				<DataTemplate>
					<Label Content="{Binding Name}"/>  //"Name" is the property of obj 
				</DataTemplate>
			</Label.ContentTemplate>
		</label>

Q: What are routed events in WPF?
Ans: Events are fired for all the controls which resides inside a control.
	There are 3 types of routed events.
		1. Direct Events - These are regular events like WinForm Events.

			Example: Button within a button - First Click of inner button is fired then Click of outer button is fired.
		3. Tunneling Events - First event of Outer control is fired and then event of Inner control is fired.

		  command which would call same method in VM. 

		  *Write a class "Command" implementing ICommand, having 2 methods and 1 event: CanExecute(), Execute(), event CanExecuteChanged.
		  *Write View-Model, call this "Command" class as property in View-Model. In View, mention command in control.
